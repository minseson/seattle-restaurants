Code for mapping changes in the Seattle restaurant scene

An attempt to map changes to date in the Seattle restaurant scene thus
far in 2015. Uses D3 and a shapefile provided by
[Zillow](http://www.zillow.com/blog/7000-neighborhood-boundary-files-in-shapefile-format-4653/).
Addresses are plotted to just Seattle neighborhoods using R's
[sp](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sp/) package.
